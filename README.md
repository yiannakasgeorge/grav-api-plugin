# Grav API Plugin

The **API Plugin** for [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) adds a REST API to Grav.

| IMPORTANT!!! This plugin is currently in development as is to be considered an **alpha release**.  As such, use this in a production environment **at your own risk!**. More features will be added in the future.

# Installation

Or clone from GitHub and put in the `user/plugins/api` folder.

# Principles

- Two URLs per resource: one for the resource collection, one for the individual resource
- Use plural forms
- Keep URLs as short as possible
- Use nouns as resource names

HTTP Method Names
- GET: read a resource or collection
- POST: create a resource
- PUT: update a resource
- DELETE: remove a resource

# HTTP Status Codes

Use meaningful HTTP Status Codes (TODO)

- 200: Success.
- 201: Created. Returned on successful creation of a new resource. Include a 'Location' header with a link to the newly-created resource.
- 400: Bad request. Data issues such as invalid JSON, etc.
- 403: Forbidden. Example: trying to create a page already existing
- 404: Not found. Resource not found on GET.
- 405: Not Allowed.
- 501: Not Implemented. Returned by default by non implemented API methods

# Things still missing

- Support filtering, sorting and pagination on collections
- Allow clients to reduce the number of fields that come back in the response
- Access control to each API method, for groups or single users
- Use http://fractal.thephpleague.com
- Allow plugins to add API methods
- Allow to limit access to a specific IP (range)
- Use OAuth2 to secure the API http://oauth2.thephpleague.com/
- JSONP
- Return the children of a page in the page request, if desired
- Allow to only retrieve some fields on API calls that are heavy on the system (e.g. `GET /api/pages/:page`)

# Authentication

In this current form the Grav API uses Basic Authentication, with the username and password currently set in Grav.
It's just a first implementation, willing to change that at least with digest authentication.

Users with `admin.super` or `admin.api` permissions can access the whole API.

## Usage or Basic Authentication on the client-side

On the client side, add the authorization header of the request as follows:

```
Authorization: Basic <Base64 encoded value>
```

the base64 value is username:password
